# Introduce myself
I'm very happy to use Github and Git introducing myself to every lovely coach here:two_hearts:!

- My **name** is **Tianying Wang**
My parents loved playing mahjong very much before I was born, so they named me Tianying, because they hope to win in mahjong forever! But luckily, it's a homophone:sweat_drops:.

- The **trajectory** of my life

When I was a child, I lived in the **Inner Mongolia**. 
It may not be true to say it, but I can ride a horse:horse:!

Later, I went from the prairie to the seaside.

**Dalian**, a romantic city where I lived and studied for 4 years.

It is worth mentioning that I am **a native of Liaoning**, but due to my parents'work, I spent my school days in Inner Mongolia, and I would go back to visit my grand parents during holidays, as well as the beautiful snow in **Shenyang**.
