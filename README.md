# Introduce myself
I'm very happy to use Github and Git introducing myself to every lovely coach here:two_hearts:!

- My **name** is **Tianying Wang**
My parents loved playing mahjong very much before I was born, so they named me Tianying, because they hope to win in mahjong forever! But luckily, it's a homophone:sweat_drops:.

When I was a child, I lived in the Inner Mongolia. 
It may not be true to say it, but I can ride a horse:horse:!
